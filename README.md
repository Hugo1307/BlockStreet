This is the first release of a Minecraft plugin which allows you to trade actions inside a Minecraft server, like in real life.

<h3>Trade Actions like in real life</h3>

With this plugin, you can buy actions from companies and wait for the future to come. If the company's actions valorize, the actions you have will valorize too. Then you have two options, hold them a little bit longer and hope them will valorize even more in the future, or sell them, and warrant some profit.

However, if the company's actions devalue and you decide to sell them then you'll lose some money. 

<h3>Follow the company actions historic</h3> 

With the in-game command <b>/invest company [id]</b> you can see the company actions historic and predict if that company will make you lose or win money.

<h3>Take a risk, but not that much</h3>

In company details, you can see the level of risk that a company offers. Companies with bigger risk will make you lose or win more money while companies with lower risk are safer, but will give you less money. 

<b>You choose!</b>
